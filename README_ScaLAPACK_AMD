ScaLAPACK For AMD
===============================================================================
ScaLAPACK, or Scalable LAPACK, is a library of high performance linear algebra 
routines for distributed memory computers supporting MPI. 

ScaLAPACK for AMD is the optimized version of ScaLAPACK for AMD EPYC family of 
processorts. 


Building Scalapack for AMD:
===============================================================================

1. Install MPI library and set the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
    variables to point to installed binaries.
   eg. export PATH=<path to MPI install directory>/bin:$PATH
   eg. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to MPI install directory>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2. Download AMD optimized versions of BLIS and libFLAME from following link
   https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocl/

3. Install BLIS and libFLAME libraries either using pre-built binaries or build 
   from source.
   To build BLIS and libFLAME from source, clone from folllowing github links
   BLIS: https://github.com/amd/blis
   libFLAME: https://github.com/amd/libflame

3. Provide the Blis and LibFlame libraries' path in the 'SLmake.inc' file.
   eg. BLASLIB_PATH       = <path to BLIS install directory>
   eg. LAPACKLIB_PATH     = <path to libFLAME install directory>

3. Run the below commands in the Scalapack folder to build Scalapack Library:
    make clean
    make 
    
4. To Build and Run the Scalapack test suite, Run the below script:
   ./scalapack_test.sh
   Build and Test logs will be generated in 'ScalaPack_Build_log.txt' and 'ScalaPack_TestResults.txt' respectively.
